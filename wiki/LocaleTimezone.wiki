#summary Setting the locale and timezone of vbit-pi

= Introduction =

Time and locale affect the service header. This is the top row of a teletext page. The time is used to display the date and time. The locale determines what language the days and months are in.

How does time work on vbit-pi? It needs an internet connection. The Pi fetches the time from an NTP server. The Pi then maintains this time as long as it is running. The current time is injected into the headers as it runs. The time is usually configured to London as that is my nearest city.

Log into your Pi and type
 sudo raspi-config

= Timezone =
Scroll down to the change_timezone option. Select your continent and your nearest city. Mine is Europe/London.
= Locale =
Locales are used to choose a language for the month and day names in the header. Please use the UTF-8 version for your country. For example, English, Great Britain, UTF-8 is called:
 [*] en_GB.UTF-8 UTF-8
Select a language by scrolling down to it and pressing space. The [*] indicates that it is selected.
Germany is probably
 de_DE.UTF-8 UTF-8
etc.
Then select OK and you will be able to choose the default locale. This is where you can set your own.
When you restart the Pi the dates will be in your new language.
